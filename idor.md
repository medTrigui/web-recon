# Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

## Introduction
IDOR vulnerabilities are among the most common web vulnerabilities that can significantly impact vulnerable web applications. They occur when a web application exposes a direct reference to an object (like a file or database resource) that end-users can control to access other similar objects. A system is considered vulnerable if any user can access any resource due to inadequate access control mechanisms.

## Why IDOR Vulnerabilities Occur
- Building solid access control systems is challenging
- Automated vulnerability detection is difficult
- Many developers overlook proper back-end access control
- Front-end restrictions alone are insufficient

## Example Scenario
Consider a file download system:
- User uploads a file and gets a link: `download.php?file_id=123`
- Without proper access control, requesting `download.php?file_id=124` might expose other users' files
- Easily guessable IDs make the vulnerability more exploitable

## What Makes an IDOR Vulnerability
1. **Direct Reference Exposure**
   - Merely exposing direct references isn't the vulnerability
   - The vulnerability stems from weak access control systems

2. **Lack of Back-end Validation**
   - Many applications only restrict access at the UI level
   - Missing back-end authentication checks
   - No Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## Impact of IDOR Vulnerabilities

### Information Disclosure
- Accessing private files and resources
- Viewing other users' personal data
- Exposure of sensitive information (e.g., credit card data)

### Data Manipulation
- Modification of other users' data
- Potential account takeover
- Deletion of unauthorized resources

### Privilege Escalation
- Elevation from standard user to administrator
- Unauthorized access to admin functions
- Potential for complete application takeover through:
  - Password changes
  - Role modifications
  - Administrative operations

## Common Attack Patterns
- Manipulating URL parameters
- Modifying API endpoints
- Testing sequential or predictable IDs
- Exploiting exposed admin functions in front-end code

## Prevention Best Practices
1. Implement robust back-end access control
2. Use unpredictable object references
3. Validate user permissions for every request
4. Implement proper Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
5. Never rely solely on front-end restrictions
